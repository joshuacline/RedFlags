# Deep below
***Flags your circle has been social engineered***
- 1. Old friends, acquaintances, exces, contacting you to glean information. It may be a just little chat to start. Things might get weird later.
- 2. Don't wait. Friends, family, roommates, or even coworkers who could have been a witness, can now be blackmailed after their participation.
- 3. You've waited too long. At this point it's self preservation. They must continue to harass or collect information on you, or else.
- 4. Gaslighting. A bit of skepticism is healthy, but not when it comes to this. They are ruining your life, one person at a time.
- 5. Coming home to disaster. Every single cord in the entire house has been physically severed in half. Electrical, ethernet, telephone, audio, and cable. Your home has the potential to be used as a warzone to wreck havoc upon you, or anyone else in the vicinity. Several reports were immediately filed with the police.
